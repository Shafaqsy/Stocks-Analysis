### Stocks Analysis refactored


## 1.Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to find the total daily volume and yearly return of both 2017 and 2018 years. The refactored code helps us run the code for each year in few seconds. It also, gives us nice, organized, and colored yearly return value for us to find out what ticker is best to invest. 
## 2.Results: 
Year 2018 shows a lot of red yearly return which means most of the stock’s growth were decrease in 2018. On the other hand, 2017 green highlighted yearly return column tells us most of the stocks were increased. If I compare the 2017 and 2018 stocks analysis data I find there’s only one stock called ENPH that increase in both years. I would say ENPH is the best stock to invest in the future.

Both original and refactored stocks analysis show up the same yearly table. All total daily volume and yearly return numbers are the same. The only difference is the code runs time. The original script takes 0.58 seconds to run 2017 year and 0.62 seconds to run 2018 year. Instead, the refactored script takes only 0.08 seconds for 2017 and 0.08 seconds for2018 year to run.

## 3.Summary:
# Advantages:
1.	Refactored code is always a good way to make our code better or someone else code better. It saves time and also reduces bugs. It helps code clean and organized and easier to understand. In our case, our refactored code runs faster than the original script.
# Pros and cons:
I would say for beginners like me who just learn how to code would have difficulties to refactored code and they would have to deal with lots of debugs as well. But, once we learn how to refactor the original code. We realize it’s a great way to keep our code keep clean, organize and run it faster. Stock analysis refactor code run way faster than the original code.
